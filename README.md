# pandas-challenge
In this code I'm utilizing Pandas library to analyse  'purchase_data.csv' data set which can be found in the Resources directory. Inside the code there are a HTMLS that define what I'm trying to achieve in each cell.
It is worth noting that formatting messes the output but if pulled and run it will provide a clean output
